0.8.8
 - Some critical path optimizations for tame to reduce the number of 
   calls to wrap.  Some might be unsafe; needs to be triple-checked.
 - Internally, tame now uses **references** instead of **pointers** when
   preparing coordination variables.
 - Remove pointer_setX, replace with refset_t	
 - Changed, yet again, the special coordination variable name from 'coordvar'
   to 'callercv.'
 - Recycle ptr<bool>'s instead of always throwing them out and reallocating
   them. Recycle limit by default is 128, but can tune it. 

0.8.7
 - Fixed bug in _block_cb3
 - Type2Struct for long long and unsigned long long
 - Fixed u_int/size_t mismatches in tame/tame.h
 - Added asrv_delayed_eof
	

0.8.6
 - Changed "unwrap" to "tame"
 - Simplified "tame" syntax; now have NONBLOCK .. JOIN instead of CRCC*
 - Added line number translation on tame output; can be disabled via the
	-L flag or by setting the NO_LINE_NUMBER environment variable
 - Turn compile on tutorial on by configure-time switch '--enable-tutorial'
 - tame -v now shows a version number.
 - Compile fixes for GCC 4.0 in rpctypes.h
 - Now, no need to do TAME(void myfn()) { .. } ; rather
   TAME void myfn () { ... } works just as well.
 - Instead of JOIN/join_group use WAIT/coordgroup
 - No more need for nonblock; use  @[]() instead

0.8.5 (pre-releases only due to versioning bug)
	
0.8.4 
 - Fix warn() statements in paillier.C so that they compile on ia64
 - Fix bugs in unwrap for trivial input files; was accessing NULL
   pointers.

0.8.3 and before 
 - Undocumented
