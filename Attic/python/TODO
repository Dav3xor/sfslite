SFS Python Wrapper Todo
------------------------

* make RPC procnos available via getsetters as opposed to method calls
	- save the programmer from typing in the parenthesis
	X make them available as static methods from the class, too,
	  this way it is not necessary to have the rpc program object
	  around [ done 4/16/05 ]

* PyDoc_STR -- use in all cases of documentating a class inline.

* aclnt:call should return a cancelable callbase

* asrv implementation

* it would be nice to have a full implementation of rpc_traverse,
  and to use that for initialization, as opposed to rolling that
  ad-hoc.  for now, we do the easier thing. 

* deep-copy so that objects are copyable.

* generic type-safe C lists; will take a fair amount of work, considering
  we will need the append, pop functions etc. basically, we should be
  wrapping DM's rpc_vectors in python types.
