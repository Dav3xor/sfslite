SFS Python Wrapper Todo
------------------------

* make RPC procnos available via getsetters as opposed to method calls
	- save the programmer from typing in the parenthesis
	X make them available as static methods from the class, too,
	  this way it is not necessary to have the rpc program object
	  around [ done 4/16/05 ]

* PyDoc_STR -- use in all cases of documentating a class inline.
