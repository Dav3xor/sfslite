0.8.6
 - Changed "unwrap" to "tame"
 - Simplified "tame" syntax; now have NONBLOCK .. JOIN instead of CRCC*
 - Added line number translation on tame output; can be disabled via the
	-L flag or by setting the NO_LINE_NUMBER environment variable
 - Turn compile on tutorial on by configure-time switch '--enable-tutorial'
 - tame -v now shows a version number.
 - Compile fixes for GCC 4.0 in rpctypes.h
 - Now, no need to do TAME(void myfn()) { .. } ; rather
   TAME void myfn () { ... } works just as well.
 - Instead of JOIN/join_group use WAIT/coordgroup
 - No more need for nonblock; use  @[]() instead
