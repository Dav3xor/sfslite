This is a port of the SFS-Lite development libraries.  The SFS toolkit
was developed to support the SFS distributed file system (see 
http://www.fs.net).  But because others use the toolkit for other reasons,
we're making SFS's libraries available as a separate package.

Maintained as port of the OKWS distribution by Maxwell Krohn.
