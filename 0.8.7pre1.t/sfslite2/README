SFSLITE HOWTO
-------------
- Based on David Mazieres's SFS (see www.fs.net)

- Build requires GMP version 4 or higher

If from CVS, then you need the GNU autotool suite, with 
libtool/libtoolize:
	
	$ autoreconf -f -i -s
	$ ./configure
	$ gmake
	$ gmake install

If from a release tarball, then just:

	$ ./configure
	$ gmake
	$ gmake install

This will install with the default build options: -O2 with static linkage,
and no dmalloc support.  Different build options accessed like:

	$ ./configure --with-mode=shdbg

etc, where the modes are:

	shdbg:	shared build, with dmalloc support, no compiler optimization
	shared: shared build, no compiler optimization
	shopt:	shared build, -O2
	debug:  static build, with dmalloc support, no compiler optimization
	deflt:	static build, -O2, no dmalloc

This library is also available as a port for FreeBSD. See:
